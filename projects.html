            Acropolis Analytics Research Institute uses computation and modeling to carry evidence from
            population-scale data into clinical practice, public policy, and the everyday lives of patients,
            families, and communities.

            <h3>Population-Adjusted Epidemiology Outcomes Network (PAEON)</h3>
            <p>
              The <strong>Population-Adjusted Epidemiology Outcomes Network (PAEON)</strong> is the
              core data backbone for Acropolis Analytics Research Institute—a unified, county-level
              outcomes engine that stitches together population denominators, behavioral risk surveys,
              infectious-disease reports, chronic-disease surveillance, structural context, and
              mortality into one reusable framework.
            </p>
            <p>
              PAEON aligns diverse datasets to a common geography and definition set so that trends
              in risk, burden, health-care use, and mortality can be compared fairly across counties,
              states, and years. Its tiered architecture includes population “Atlas” layers, behavioral
              risk, infectious and chronic morbidity, hospital utilization, mortality, environment,
              mobility, crime, and access to care—providing an annual, population-adjusted view of
              health and context for every U.S. county.
            </p>
            <p>
              The goal is straightforward: build a reproducible data engine that public-health agencies,
              clinicians, and policymakers can use to answer hard questions about who is at risk, where
              systems are failing or improving, and which interventions are most likely to move the needle.
            </p>

            <h4>PAEON I &mdash; PAX: Border Demographics, Disease &amp; Crime</h4>
            <p>
              <strong>PAX</strong> is the first large-scale demonstration of the PAEON backbone, focused on
              the U.S.–Mexico border corridor defined by the La Paz Agreement (roughly 100 km on either
              side of the border). PAX produces a baseline atlas of how the region has changed since 1990:
              who lives there, and how burdens of chronic disease, infectious disease, and crime have moved
              over time.
            </p>
            <p>
              Using harmonized U.S. and Mexican data, PAX generates population-adjusted, county- and
              state-level estimates for four domains: demographics, chronic disease, infectious disease,
              and crime &amp; violence. Outputs include standardized maps, tables, and time-series panels
              that allow side-by-side comparison of border vs. non-border areas in both countries, with
              careful documentation of uncertainty and data gaps.
            </p>

            <h4>PAEON II &mdash; AORTA: National Cardiovascular Disease Burden</h4>
            <p>
              <strong>AORTA</strong> extends PAEON to cardiovascular disease (CVD), describing how CVD risk
              and burden are distributed and changing across all U.S. counties. It integrates demographic
              denominators, surveillance data, and state-level composition to create reconciled,
              population-adjusted county-year estimates of CVD prevalence and mortality that are comparable
              across states, rural vs. urban areas, and levels of social vulnerability.
            </p>
            <p>
              AORTA then builds multivariable models that relate demographic, behavioral, metabolic, and
              structural factors&mdash;such as smoking, obesity, diabetes, insurance coverage, and poverty&mdash;
              to CVD morbidity and mortality. The result is a national CVD risk atlas that highlights where
              burden is rising or falling, quantifies geographic inequalities, and supports scenario-based
              planning for prevention and treatment resources.
            </p>

            <h4>PAEON III &mdash; PANCREA: Diabetes &amp; Metabolic Risk</h4>
            <p>
              <strong>PANCREA</strong> focuses on diabetes and related metabolic risk. Built on the same
              PAEON backbone, it generates county-level estimates of diabetes prevalence, obesity, physical
              inactivity, and related indicators over time, enabling fair comparisons within and across
              states, between rural and urban communities, and across levels of social vulnerability.
            </p>
            <p>
              PANCREA links these indicators to mortality and access-to-care measures, then models how
              demographic, behavioral, metabolic, and structural factors shape diabetes morbidity and
              mortality. It also connects directly to AORTA, producing joint cardiovascular–diabetes risk
              structures and scenario forecasts that help planners see how changes in obesity, activity,
              or preventive care could shift future burden.
            </p>

            <h4>PAEON IV &mdash; PNEUMA: Chronic Respiratory Disease Burden</h4>
            <p>
              <strong>PNEUMA</strong> tracks chronic respiratory diseases—especially COPD and asthma—across
              U.S. counties. It produces harmonized, population-adjusted county-year estimates of respiratory
              morbidity and mortality, with consistent age adjustment and uncertainty reporting, so that
              patterns can be compared across rural and urban counties and across different vulnerability levels.
            </p>
            <p>
              Beyond burden mapping, PNEUMA models how tobacco exposure, occupational hazards, and environmental
              conditions contribute to geographic inequalities in respiratory health. It also builds a baseline
              vulnerability surface that can later be overlaid with air-quality and wildfire-smoke data,
              supporting environmental-health preparedness.
            </p>

          <!-- PAEON V — MNEME -->
          <div class="card">
            <h3>PAEON V &mdash; MNEME: Cognitive Decline &amp; Caregiver Burden</h3>
            <p>
              <strong>MNEME</strong> applies the PAEON framework to cognitive decline and caregiving. It
              assembles sparse but growing surveillance data on self-reported memory problems, cognitive
              decline, and caregiver burden to generate modeled county-level estimates, carefully propagating
              uncertainty and documenting where data are thin.
            </p>
            <p>
              MNEME aims to identify where dementia-like burden and dependence on long-term care systems are
              rising fastest—particularly in aging rural areas and socioeconomically strained communities.
              It links cognitive outcomes with chronic disease, behavioral, and access indicators to model
              determinants of decline and caregiver strain, and to forecast future demand for long-term care
              and support services.
            </p>
          </div>

          <!-- PAEON VI — ONKOS -->
          <div class="card">
            <h3>PAEON VI &mdash; ONKOS: Cancer Screening &amp; Oncologic Risk</h3>
            <p>
              <strong>ONKOS</strong> concentrates on cancer screening and preventable oncologic risk. Using
              survey and surveillance data, it builds county-level, population-adjusted estimates of colorectal,
              lung (among eligible adults), and cervical cancer screening, alongside contextual risk factors and
              access barriers.
            </p>
            <p>
              ONKOS maps where screening uptake is persistently low, how gaps vary by rurality, race/ethnicity,
              and social vulnerability, and which counties remain structurally underserved. It is designed to be
              linked to cancer registry data in future work, enabling analyses of stage at diagnosis, survival,
              and preventable burden.
            </p>

          <!-- ADRD Caregiver Survey -->
          <div class="card">
            <h3>ADRD Caregiver Experience &amp; Burden Survey</h3>
            <p>
              Many Alzheimer’s and dementia programs only see formal caregiver data every few years, even
              though caregivers’ lives can change dramatically in a matter of months. Acropolis Analytics
              Research Institute is developing a facility-level
              <strong>Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Dementias (ADRD) Caregiver Experience &amp; Burden Survey</strong>
              that organizations can run on a recurring basis.
            </p>
            <p>
              The project adapts state-level caregiver survey work into a format that individual ADRD and
              memory facilities and programs can deploy with their own patients’ and residents’ families.
              The instrument focuses on who caregivers are, how caregiving affects their work and finances,
              the time and tasks they take on, how it impacts their physical and mental health, and which
              supports they still cannot access.
            </p>
            <p>
              Acropolis Analytics Research Institute provides participating facilities with de-identified
              datasets and clear, visual reports that track caregiver burden over time and highlight unmet
              needs. As capacity allows, recurring analyses (often annually) will be produced for partners,
              and aggregated, de-identified summaries and graphics will be made available through the
              <strong>Data &amp; Graphics</strong> section of this site. Over the long term, this project is
              designed to connect with the broader PAEON / MNEME framework, linking facility-level caregiver
              experience to county-level patterns in cognitive decline and caregiver strain.

          <!-- Collaborations -->
          <div class="card">
            <h3>Collaborations</h3>
            <p>
              Acropolis Analytics Research Institute is built to work alongside other people’s strengths.
              We collaborate with universities, state and local health departments, clinical and long-term
              care facilities, laboratory groups, and non-profit organizations that want to turn their
              data and questions into usable evidence.
            </p>
            <p>
              On the quantitative side, we bring expertise in large-scale data integration, epidemiologic
              and statistical modeling, survey design and analysis, and reproducible reporting. On the
              translational side, we focus on connecting what happens in clinics, facilities, and programs
              to population-level questions and policy-relevant outcomes.
            </p>
            <p>
              Collaborations can range from one-off analytic support and technical consultation to
              co-developed grant applications, shared datasets, and long-term joint projects. The common
              thread is simple: we look for partners who care about moving high-quality science toward
              better medicine, better policy, and better outcomes for the people they serve.
