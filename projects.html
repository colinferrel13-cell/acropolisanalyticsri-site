            Acropolis Analytics Research Institute uses computation and modeling to carry evidence from
            population-scale data into clinical practice, public policy, and the everyday lives of patients,
            families, and communities.

  <h3>Population-Adjusted Epidemiology Outcomes Network (PAEON)</h3>
  <p>
    The <strong>Population-Adjusted Epidemiology Outcomes Network (PAEON)</strong> is the
    core data backbone for Acropolis Analytics Research Institute—a unified, county-level
    outcomes engine that stitches together population denominators, behavioral risk surveys,
    infectious-disease reports, chronic-disease surveillance, structural context, and
    mortality into one reusable framework.
  </p>
  <p>
    PAEON aligns diverse datasets to a common geography and definition set so that trends
    in risk, burden, health-care use, and mortality can be compared fairly across counties,
    states, and years. Its tiered architecture includes population “Atlas” layers, behavioral
    risk, infectious and chronic morbidity, hospital utilization, mortality, environment,
    mobility, crime, and access to care—providing an annual, population-adjusted view of
    health and context for every U.S. county.
  </p>
  <p>
    The goal is straightforward: build a reproducible data engine that public-health agencies,
    clinicians, and policymakers can use to answer hard questions about who is at risk, where
    systems are failing or improving, and which interventions are most likely to move the needle.

    </div>

    <div class="substudy">
      <h5>PAEON I — PAX: Border Demographics, Disease &amp; Crime</h5>
      <p>
        <strong>PAX</strong> is the first large-scale demonstration of the PAEON backbone, focused on
        the U.S.–Mexico border corridor defined by the La Paz Agreement (roughly 100 km on either
        side of the border). PAX produces a baseline atlas of how the region has changed since 1990:
        who lives there, and how burdens of chronic disease, infectious disease, and crime have moved
        over time.
      </p>
      <p>
        Using harmonized U.S. and Mexican data, PAX generates population-adjusted, county- and
        state-level estimates for four domains: demographics, chronic disease, infectious disease,
        and crime &amp; violence. Outputs include standardized maps, tables, and time-series panels
        that allow side-by-side comparison of border vs. non-border areas in both countries, with
        careful documentation of uncertainty and data gaps.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="substudy">
      <h5>PAEON II — AORTA: National Cardiovascular Disease Burden</h5>
      <p>
        <strong>AORTA</strong> extends PAEON to cardiovascular disease (CVD), describing how CVD risk
        and burden are distributed and changing across all U.S. counties. It integrates demographic
        denominators, surveillance data, and state-level composition to create reconciled,
        population-adjusted county-year estimates of CVD prevalence and mortality that are comparable
        across states, rural vs. urban areas, and levels of social vulnerability.
      </p>
      <p>
        AORTA then builds multivariable models that relate demographic, behavioral, metabolic, and
        structural factors—such as smoking, obesity, diabetes, insurance coverage, and poverty—to CVD
        morbidity and mortality. The result is a national CVD risk atlas that highlights where burden
        is rising or falling, quantifies geographic inequalities, and supports scenario-based planning
        for prevention and treatment resources.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="substudy">
      <h5>PAEON III — PANCREA: Diabetes &amp; Metabolic Risk</h5>
      <p>
        <strong>PANCREA</strong> focuses on diabetes and related metabolic risk. Built on the same
        PAEON backbone, it generates county-level estimates of diabetes prevalence, obesity, physical
        inactivity, and related indicators over time, enabling fair comparisons within and across
        states, between rural and urban communities, and across levels of social vulnerability.
      </p>
      <p>
        PANCREA links these indicators to mortality and access-to-care measures, then models how
        demographic, behavioral, metabolic, and structural factors shape diabetes morbidity and
        mortality. It also connects directly to AORTA, producing joint cardiovascular–diabetes risk
        structures and scenario forecasts that help planners see how changes in obesity, activity,
        or preventive care could shift future burden.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="substudy">
      <h5>PAEON IV — PNEUMA: Chronic Respiratory Disease Burden</h5>
      <p>
        <strong>PNEUMA</strong> tracks chronic respiratory diseases—especially COPD and asthma—across
        U.S. counties. It produces harmonized, population-adjusted county-year estimates of respiratory
        morbidity and mortality, with consistent age adjustment and uncertainty reporting, so that
        patterns can be compared across rural and urban counties and across different vulnerability levels.
      </p>
      <p>
        Beyond burden mapping, PNEUMA models how tobacco exposure, occupational hazards, and environmental
        conditions contribute to geographic inequalities in respiratory health. It also builds a baseline
        vulnerability surface that can later be overlaid with air-quality and wildfire-smoke data,
        supporting environmental-health preparedness.

          <!-- ADRD Caregiver Survey -->
          <div class="card">
            <h3>ADRD Caregiver Experience &amp; Burden Survey</h3>
            <p>
              Many Alzheimer’s and dementia programs only see formal caregiver data every few years, even
              though caregivers’ lives can change dramatically in a matter of months. Acropolis Analytics
              Research Institute is developing a facility-level
              <strong>Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Dementias (ADRD) Caregiver Experience &amp; Burden Survey</strong>
              that organizations can run on a recurring basis.
            </p>
            <p>
              The project adapts state-level caregiver survey work into a format that individual ADRD and
              memory facilities and programs can deploy with their own patients’ and residents’ families.
              The instrument focuses on who caregivers are, how caregiving affects their work and finances,
              the time and tasks they take on, how it impacts their physical and mental health, and which
              supports they still cannot access.
            </p>
            <p>
              Acropolis Analytics Research Institute provides participating facilities with de-identified
              datasets and clear, visual reports that track caregiver burden over time and highlight unmet
              needs. As capacity allows, recurring analyses (often annually) will be produced for partners,
              and aggregated, de-identified summaries and graphics will be made available through the
              <strong>Data &amp; Graphics</strong> section of this site. Over the long term, this project is
              designed to connect with the broader PAEON / MNEME framework, linking facility-level caregiver
              experience to county-level patterns in cognitive decline and caregiver strain.

          <!-- Collaborations -->
          <div class="card">
            <h3>Collaborations</h3>
            <p>
              Acropolis Analytics Research Institute is built to work alongside other people’s strengths.
              We collaborate with universities, state and local health departments, clinical and long-term
              care facilities, laboratory groups, and non-profit organizations that want to turn their
              data and questions into usable evidence.
            </p>
            <p>
              On the quantitative side, we bring expertise in large-scale data integration, epidemiologic
              and statistical modeling, survey design and analysis, and reproducible reporting. On the
              translational side, we focus on connecting what happens in clinics, facilities, and programs
              to population-level questions and policy-relevant outcomes.
            </p>
            <p>
              Collaborations can range from one-off analytic support and technical consultation to
              co-developed grant applications, shared datasets, and long-term joint projects. The common
              thread is simple: we look for partners who care about moving high-quality science toward
              better medicine, better policy, and better outcomes for the people they serve.
