          <p>
            Acropolis Analytics Research Institute maintains this Data Library as a structured home
            for aggregated, de-identified outputs across projects and years. Over time, this will
            include Summary Tables, Geospatial Layers, Maps, and Figures that partners can reuse
            in their own analysis and planning.

            <h3>How This Library Is Organized</h3>
            <p>
              As the number of projects and releases grows, this section will be organized along
              a few simple axes:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>By project or program</strong> (for example, PAEON, caregiver surveys, facility-level studies)</li>
              <li><strong>By topic</strong> (for example, chronic disease, screening, access, caregiver burden, or future domains)</li>
              <li><strong>By year or time window</strong> (single years, multi-year ranges, or Baseline vs. Follow-Up)</li>
              <li><strong>By format</strong> (Summary Tables, Geospatial Layers, Maps, and Graphics)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              The goal is to make it possible for someone who was not involved in the original
              work to find the right dataset, understand what it represents, and use it safely.
            </p>
          </div>

          <!-- Project index / placeholder -->
          <div class="card">
            <h3>Project Index (In Development)</h3>
            <p>
              As public releases become available, this section will list datasets and graphics
              grouped by project, with links to download files and read brief documentation.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>PAEON</strong> &mdash; Population-Adjusted Epidemiology Outcomes Network,
                providing County-Level Summaries and Risk Surfaces derived from harmonized
                population, survey, and surveillance data.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Caregiver &amp; facility-level projects</strong> &mdash; aggregated results
                from Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Dementias (ADRD) Caregiver Surveys and similar
                instruments deployed in facilities and programs.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Other applied projects</strong> &mdash; future work in additional domains
                (for example, environmental or agricultural data) that uses the same structured
                approach to integration and modeling.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              For now, these entries are placeholders; as releases are finalized, each project will
              gain its own subsection with specific files, years, and notes.
            </p>
          </div>

          <!-- PAEON data (future structure) -->
          <div class="card">
            <h3>PAEON-Derived Data (Planned Structure)</h3>
            <p>
              For PAEON, the Data Library is expected to host stable, reusable Summaries rather
              than every intermediate modeling artifact. A typical release might include:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>County-Level Summary Tables for selected indicators (for example, prevalence, rates, or screening coverage)</li>
              <li>Border-Region Extracts for specific corridors or comparison groups</li>
              <li>Modeled Burden and Risk Summaries for selected years or year ranges</li>
              <li>Basic Crosswalks and Code Lists to support downstream analyses</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              When the first PAEON releases are ready, they will appear here with download links
              and short Methods Notes that explain sources, inclusion criteria, and modeling
              choices at a high level.
            </p>
          </div>

          <!-- Facility / caregiver outputs (future structure) -->
          <div class="card">
            <h3>Caregiver &amp; Facility-Level Outputs</h3>
            <p>
              For Caregiver Surveys and facility-level projects, the focus will be on de-identified,
              aggregated results that illustrate patterns and trends without exposing individual records.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Summary Tables describing caregiver characteristics and burden metrics</li>
              <li>Facility-Level or Regional Aggregates where sample sizes support safe reporting</li>
              <li>Selected Graphs and Maps used in partner reports, made available as image files</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Facility-specific datasets and internal reports will remain under their respective
              agreements and will not be posted in raw form to this public library.
            </p>
          </div>

          <!-- Formats & documentation -->
          <div class="card">
            <h3>Formats &amp; Documentation</h3>
            <p>
              Regardless of project, each public data release will come with enough context to be
              interpretable on its own.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Machine-readable files (for example, CSV or similar Tabular Formats)</li>
              <li>Short Data Dictionaries describing variables, units, and key recodes</li>
              <li>Methods Notes summarizing data sources and high-level modeling approaches</li>
              <li>Version Labels and Release Dates so users can track updates over time</li>
            </ul>

          <!-- Access & custom collaboration -->
          <div class="card">
            <h3>Access &amp; Custom Work</h3>
            <p>
              The public data listed here is intended for broad use in planning, research, and
              communication. If you are interested in custom Extracts, Project-Specific Analyses,
              or additional Modeling built on these datasets, Acropolis Analytics Research Institute
              can often support that work as a separate engagement.
            </p>
