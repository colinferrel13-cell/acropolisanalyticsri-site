          <p>
            Acropolis Analytics Research Institute builds computation- and modeling-based research tools
            that help carry evidence from science into medicine, from medicine into policy, and from policy
            into measurable improvements in the health of patients and communities.

            <h3>Approach</h3>
            <p>
              Acropolis Analytics Research Institute starts from a simple chain of responsibility:
              <strong>science should inform medicine, medicine should inform policy, and policy should
              meaningfully improve the health of patients and communities.</strong> The institute focuses on
              computation- and modeling-based research that can translate complex data—whether from
              epidemiology, clinical science, or laboratory work—into clear, testable insights along that chain.
            </p>
            <p>
              Rather than limiting its work to classical epidemiology, Acropolis Analytics Research Institute
              builds platforms and models that connect multiple domains: population-level surveillance, clinical
              outcomes, and emerging biomedical technologies. The goal is to produce analyses and tools that are
              both methodologically rigorous and directly usable—whether that means guiding clinical trials,
              shaping state and federal policy, or helping health systems and agencies understand where to act first.

            <h3>Founder</h3>
            <p>
              <strong>Colin Ferrel, MPH</strong> is an epidemiologist and nanomedicine researcher who founded
              Acropolis Analytics Research Institute to bridge rigorous bench science with decision-focused public
              health analytics. His work centers on modular nanotechnology, infectious disease, and chronic disease
              surveillance, with a particular focus on tools that can be rapidly adapted for both civilian health
              systems and national preparedness.
            </p>
            <p>
              Colin holds a B.S. in Psychology, a B.S. in Medical Microbiology, and an M.P.H. in Infectious
              Diseases/Zoonoses from Kansas State University, along with graduate certificates in Agricultural
              Biosecurity Research, Applied Statistics, and Interdisciplinary Medical Sciences. He spent five years
              at the Nanotechnology Innovation Center of Kansas State (NICKS) under Dr. Santosh Aryal, developing
              hybrid nanoparticle platforms that fuse red blood cell membranes with synthetic lipid bilayers to
              improve biocompatibility, targeting, and drug delivery—experience that underpins his long-term goal
              of creating adaptable nanoplatforms with interchangeable targeting and payload components.
            </p>
            <p>
              In parallel with his lab work, Colin has served as an Epidemiologist at the Texas Department of State
              Health Services, first in Tuberculosis and Hansen’s Disease, and now within the Chronic Disease
              Epidemiology Branch as the Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Dementias (ADRD) and Obesity Prevention
              Epidemiologist. He also co-chairs the Data Workgroup for the Texas Alzheimer’s Association, collaborating
              with public health, clinical, and academic partners to build statewide surveillance for cognitive decline
              and caregiver burden. Earlier in his career, he supported regional surveillance of
              <em>Streptococcus pneumoniae</em> and vaccine effectiveness at the Sedgwick County Division of Health.
            </p>
            <p>
              Colin’s research portfolio includes peer-reviewed work in nanomedicine, magnetic nanoparticle imaging,
              extracellular vesicles, and population-level analyses of chronic disease and youth risk behaviors.
              Across these domains, he is guided by the Kansas motto <em>“Ad Astra Per Aspera”</em>—to the stars
              through difficulties—and by a conviction that advanced biomedical tools and careful epidemiology
              should ultimately serve patients, communities, and those working on the front lines of care and
              public protection.
