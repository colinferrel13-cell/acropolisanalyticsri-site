            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p>
              The Reports section is intended as a Reading Library&mdash;a place to see how
              Data, Models, and Field Experience come together in written form. Over time,
              it will include a mix of Formal Reports, Slide Decks, and selected Manuscripts
              that illustrate the kinds of questions Acropolis Analytics Research Institute
              helps answer.
            </p>
            <p>
              Documents posted here are typically Final or Near-Final Versions that can be
              shared publicly or with broad Partner Audiences. Internal Drafts and
              Confidential Materials will not appear in this space.

          <div class="card">
            <h3>Project Reports &amp; Briefs</h3>
            <p>
              As projects mature, key written outputs will be listed here with short
              descriptions and links to downloadable files (for example, PDFs or Slide Decks).
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Project Summaries and Technical Reports for major analytic engagements</li>

              <li>Methodological Appendices for readers who want additional detail</li>
            </ul>

              When available, each entry will note the Primary Project (for example, PAEON
              or Caregiver Surveys), the Year, and the Intended Audience to help readers
              find what is most relevant to them.

            <h3>Presentations &amp; Slide Decks</h3>
            <p>
              Many findings are first shared in meetings, webinars, or conference settings.
              This section will collect selected Slide Decks and Presentation Materials that
              can be made available outside those events.

              <li>Annotated Decks that walk through key Figures, Maps, and Conclusions</li>
            </ul>

              Presentations may be lightly edited to remove any sensitive or partner-specific
              details before being posted.
