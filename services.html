            Acropolis Analytics Research Institute offers computation- and modeling-based support
            that connects population-scale data, facility-level surveys, and applied research
            questions to real-world decisions in science, policy, and practice.

            <h3>Population &amp; Survey Data Integration</h3>
            <p>
              Build a clean, defensible data backbone before you start modeling. We specialize in
              harmonizing public-health datasets into common geographies and definitions, often as
              part of the broader PAEON framework.
            </p>

            <h3>Modeling, Risk Surfaces &amp; Scenario Work</h3>
            <p>
              Turn integrated data into risk maps and projections that answer policy-relevant
              questions while respecting uncertainty and bias.

          <div class="card">
            <h3>Facility &amp; Program-Level Analytics</h3>
            <p>
              Help facilities and programs collect the right data, interpret it clearly, and use it
              to advocate for resources and redesign care.

            <h3>Engagement Model</h3>
            <p>
              Most collaborations begin with a short scoping conversation to clarify:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>The primary decision, policy, or grant question you are trying to answer</li>
              <li>Which datasets are available and what constraints apply to their use</li>
              <li>Desired timelines, deliverables, and how code and outputs will be shared or maintained</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              From there, engagements may range from a one-time analytic consult to a recurring,
              multi-year modeling partnership. To start that process, please
              <a href="contact.html">submit a brief inquiry</a> describing your data environment
              and goals.
