          <h2>What We Do</h2>

          <!-- High-level philosophy -->
          <div class="card">
            <p>
              Acropolis Analytics Research Institute is built around a simple idea:
              large, messy data only becomes useful when it is structured, documented,
              and tied to specific decisions.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Institute develops Computation- and Modeling-Based Projects that
              sit at the intersection of Data, Methods, and Practice rather than
              treating analysis as a one-off task.
            </p>
          </div>

          <!-- Concrete actions -->
          <div class="card">
            <p>
              In practical terms, that means work that:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Harmonizes Population Data, Surveys, and Surveillance into stable analytic
                backbones across years and jurisdictions.
              </li>
              <li>
                Builds Models and Risk Summaries that respect Survey Design, Bias, and
                Uncertainty instead of hiding them.
              </li>
              <li>
                Translates results into Reports, Maps, and Briefs that non-technical
                audiences can use in day-to-day work.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Work can range from one-time Analytic Consults to multi-year Modeling
              Partnerships, depending on the needs of the agency or research team.

            <h3>PAEON &mdash; Population-Adjusted Epidemiology Outcomes Network</h3>
            <p>
              PAEON is a growing Modeling Backbone that harmonizes Denominators and
              Outcomes across Major U.S. datasets to support County-Level and
              Border-Region surveillance.
            </p>
            <p>
              Early Labors within PAEON include:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>PAEON I &mdash; PAX</strong>: Border Demographics, Chronic Disease, Infectious Disease &amp; Crime</li>
              <li><strong>PAEON II &mdash; AORTA</strong>: National Cardiovascular Risk &amp; Burden</li>
              <li><strong>PAEON III &mdash; PANCREA</strong>: National Diabetes &amp; Metabolic Risk</li>
              <li><strong>PAEON IV &mdash; PNEUMA</strong>: National Chronic Respiratory Disease Burden</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              As PAEON matures, selected County-Level Summaries and Risk Surfaces will be
              posted in the <a href="data.html">Data</a> section, with Methods Notes and
              Crosswalks to support reuse.

            <h3>Caregiver &amp; Facility-Level Work</h3>
            <p>
              Acropolis Analytics Research Institute also supports projects that focus
              on Caregivers and Facilities, including Alzheimer’s Disease and Related
              Dementias (ADRD) Caregiver Surveys and similar Instruments.

          <!-- How engagements start -->
          <div class="card">
            <p>
              Most collaborations begin with a short Scoping Conversation to clarify:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>The Decision, Policy, or Grant Question you are trying to answer</li>
              <li>Which Datasets are available and what constraints apply to their use</li>
              <li>Timelines, Deliverables, and how Code and Outputs will be shared or maintained</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              From there, the Institute can help identify whether you need a one-time
              Analysis, a recurring Reporting Structure, or a deeper Modeling Backbone
              like PAEON.
