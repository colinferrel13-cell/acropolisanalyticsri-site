            This page will host public, de-identified data releases and selected outputs from
            Acropolis Analytics Research Institute projects, starting with PAEON and related
            caregiver and facility-level work.

          <div class="card">
            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p>
              The goal of this section is to make key results and reference tables broadly
              available without exposing individual-level records. Over time, this will
              include county-level summary datasets, crosswalks, and visual outputs that
              partners can reuse in their own planning and reporting.
            </p>
            <p>
              All data posted here will be aggregated, de-identified, and accompanied by
              brief documentation describing sources, methods, and version history.
            </p>
          </div>

          <!-- PAEON data -->
          <div class="card">
            <h3>PAEON-Derived Data (In Development)</h3>
            <p>
              As the Population-Adjusted Epidemiology Outcomes Network (PAEON) matures,
              selected outputs will be published here as static reference files.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>County-level summary tables for chronic disease, screening, and access indicators</li>
              <li>Border-region extracts from PAEON I &mdash; PAX (U.S.–Mexico corridor)</li>
              <li>Modeled burden and risk summaries from AORTA, PANCREA, PNEUMA, MNEME, and ONKOS</li>
              <li>Basic crosswalks and code lists to support downstream analyses</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Initial releases are expected to focus on stable, widely used indicators and
              simple tabular formats (for example, CSV files) that can be ingested by most
              statistical and GIS tools.

            <h3>Caregiver &amp; Facility-Level Outputs (Planned)</h3>
            <p>
              For ADRD caregiver and facility-level projects, Acropolis Analytics Research
              Institute plans to publish aggregated, de-identified summaries that illustrate
              patterns in caregiver burden and related outcomes.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Summary tables of caregiver characteristics, time and task burden, and reported stress</li>
              <li>Facility-level or regional aggregates where sample sizes permit safe reporting</li>
              <li>Selected figures and graphics used in partner reports</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Facility-specific or partner-specific datasets will only be shared under
              appropriate agreements and will not appear here in raw form.

              Each data release will include enough context for another analyst to understand
              what they are looking at and how it was created.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Machine-readable files (for example, CSV or similar tabular formats)</li>

              <li>Methods notes summarizing sources, inclusion criteria, and modeling approaches</li>
              <li>Version labels and release dates so users can track updates over time</li>

            <h3>Access &amp; Custom Work</h3>
            <p>
              The public data listed here is intended for broad use in planning, research,
              and communication. If you are interested in custom extracts, facility-specific
              reports, or additional modeling built on these datasets, Acropolis Analytics
              Research Institute can often support that work as a separate engagement.
